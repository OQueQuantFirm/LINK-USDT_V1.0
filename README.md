   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

#### Step 3: Install Required Packages
1. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Step 4: Launch Jupyter Notebook
1. Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:

2. Click on the file to open it.

#### Step 6: Setting Up Environment Variables
1. You need to set up API keys and other credentials as environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project directory.
2. Add your API key, secret key, and passphrase to the `.env` file like this:
   ```
   API_KEY='your_api_key'
   SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key'
   PASSPHRASE='your_passphrase'
   ```
3. Save the `.env` file.

#### Step 7: Run the Notebook

#### Step 9: Save Your Work
- Regularly save your notebook to prevent any loss of data.

#### Step 10: Exit Jupyter Notebook
- Once done, you can stop the Jupyter Notebook server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in your terminal or command prompt.
- Deactivate the virtual environment (if used) by typing `deactivate`.

#### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues, check the Python and package versions for compatibility.
- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set up as per your API and trading account.
